Claude Diagnostic Client
========================

Sends a chunk of log lines to the Anthropic API and returns:
  - A structured diagnosis for the detected issue
  - Any new issue patterns Claude identifies that are absent from known_issues.json

Authentication: reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the environment (standard SDK behaviour).

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert SRE diagnostic agent specialising in OpenShift, Kubernetes, \
and ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS) infrastructure.

You will receive a JSON object with:
  - issue_type        : the pattern type that was matched in the log stream
  - log_chunk         : error/failure log lines with 10 lines of context before
                        and after each one; windows are separated by "--- window N ---"
                        markers. If no error lines were found the full tail is sent.
  - existing_patterns : types + descriptions of patterns already in known_issues.json
  - available_fix_strategies : valid keys from fix_strategies.json

Your tasks:
1. Diagnose the root cause of the detected issue using the log evidence.
2. Select the best fix strategy from the provided list.
3. Identify any NEW issue patterns visible in the log chunk that are NOT already
   covered by the existing patterns.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON — no markdown, no prose — in exactly this structure:

{
  "diagnosis": {
    "issue_type": "<the issue_type provided>",
    "root_cause": "<specific root cause — 1-2 sentences>",
    "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
    "confidence": <float 0.0-1.0>,
    "evidence": ["<specific log line or observation>", ...],
    "recommended_fix": "<one of the available_fix_strategies keys>",
    "fix_parameters": {}
  },
  "new_patterns": [
    {
      "type": "<unique_snake_case_identifier>",
      "pattern": "<valid Python regex, case-insensitive>",
      "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
      "auto_fix": false,
      "description": "<what this issue is>",
      "symptoms": ["<observable symptom>"],
      "common_causes": ["<likely root cause>"]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- recommended_fix MUST be one of the provided available_fix_strategies keys.
  Use "log_and_continue" if none fit.
- new_patterns MUST be [] when all visible issues are already covered by
  existing_patterns or when no distinct new issue is visible.
- confidence reflects certainty about the root cause given the log evidence
  (0.0 = guessing, 1.0 = definitive from explicit log evidence).
- evidence entries must quote or paraphrase actual lines from the log_chunk.

        Ask Claude to diagnose an issue from a log chunk.

        Only error/failure lines (and 10 lines of context around each) are sent

        the last 30 lines are sent as a fallback.

        ----------
        issue_type
            The pattern type matched by the monitoring agent.
        log_chunk
            Full sliding-window buffer from the monitoring agent.
        known_patterns
            Current entries from known_issues.json — used for deduplication.
        fix_strategy_keys
            Valid keys from fix_strategies.json — Claude must choose from these.

        -------
        diagnosis
            Structured dict ready for the remediation agent, or None on failure.
